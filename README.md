# Uncommon JavaScript While Loop Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a JavaScript `while` loop involving the `break` statement. The loop is intended to iterate 10 times, but the `break` statement prematurely terminates it when the counter reaches 5.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of careful loop control and understanding the behavior of `break` statements within loops.
